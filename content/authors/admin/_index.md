ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lieke Adams ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my Msc. Marketing Analytics at Tilburg University. 

I am a student who tries to develop myself everyday even more besides my study program. During my studies I learned a lot in R & Python for my courses additionally I am also working part time as a Data engineer at Springbok. During this job I am developing in SQL, Python and dashboarding, the latter in order to visualize the data retrieved by my SQL scripts in Big Query.
