Lieke Adams is an active student. Eager to learn more. Very neat and works structured. 

These are a few sort sentences which would describe me. I am a student who tries to develop myself everyday even more besides my study program. Because of this and my other qualities, I think I would be a suitable, flexible, motivated and enthusiastic addition to a company
