ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lieke Adams ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my Msc. Marketing Analytics at Tilburg University. 

During my studies I learned a lot in R & Python for my courses. Additionally I am working part time as a Data engineer at Springbok. As a Data engineer, I am developing in SQL, Python and dashboarding. The latter in order to visualize the data retrieved by my SQL scripts through Big Query in the Google Cloud Platform.
