title: Rutte's influence on taking a shot
summary: This study was conducted as part of the course, Online Data Collections (oDCM) from Tilburg University. The cleaned data by the scraper built will then be used for the course, Data Prep and Workflow Management (dPrep) from Tilburg University. What effect do the Dutch government's press conferences have on the attitude of their citizens towards the covid-vaccin? With help of a webscraper, utilizing the chromedriver Selenium, tweets were gathered. The amount of tweets increased drastically around 19 november 2020. During this time the Dutch government announced during that time, that they were going to buy the corona-vaccins for the Dutch citizens.
