## Overview

In order to discover my limits and to push them. To drive myself to go 120%. Combines with a lot of healthy eating entailed competitive rowing ('wedstrijdroeien’) for me! I started rowing in the Dutch National KNRB competition, while combining a Bachelor studies at University. 

As a competitive rower at T.S.R. Vidar professional coaches train and mentor you. I've rowed at (inter)national races and was constantly working on improving myself and pushing my boundaries. I rowed at top sport level and trained to become a rowing
athlete.

## My personal role

During my Bachelor I started my rowing career. In your first year, you learn the principles of rowing. In autumn, the selections are made of the first year teams and coaches guide and prepare you for the rowing season. Eventually you will start races in the ‘eerstejaars klassement’ (first year classification) against the first year teams of other student rowing associations in the Netherlands.

In order to perform as well as possible, you and your crew train 5 to 8 times a week, you learn to row as fast as possible whilst building a strong team bond. Besides normal trainings at Vidar there are also training camps where you travel with the entire selection to Seville.
